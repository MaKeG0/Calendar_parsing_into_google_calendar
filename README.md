# ITS-Parse-Calendar

Hello everybody.

I'm a IT beginner and learning something new day by day.

This is my first GitHub public repo, don't judge me too hard.

I've created this script to parse an .ods calendar that i needed to import in calendar fast.

You will need to get your token for the API on google, i've just called it credentials.json.

Please feel free to give me suggestions and copy this script for your needs.
