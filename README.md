# ITS-Parse-Calendar

Hello everybody.

I'm a IT beginner and learning something new day by day.

This is my first GitHub public repo, don't judge me too hard.

I've created this script to parse an .ods calendar that i needed to import in calendar fast.

Please feel free to give me suggestions and copy this script for your needs.
